      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m a third year graduate student in Computer Graphics at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Eitan Grinspun.
My interests lie at the intersection of physics based animation and geometry processing. Specifically I like how the two can often intermingle in just the right way to provide rich features useful for shape analysis, motion discovery, simulation acceleration, and control over animated characters.
I recently received my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree at the University of Toronto, where I was co-supervised by Profs Eitan Grinspun and Alec Jacobson.</description>
