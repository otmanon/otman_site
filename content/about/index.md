I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Graphics 
at the University of Toronto, advised by [Prof. Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/).

I love visual storytelling, and a huge component of that 
is the world-building required that breathes life into these stories.
My research lies at the intersection of physics-based animation and control.
I'm particularly interested in not only investigating
good computational models for natural phenomena, but also
