Hello! I'm a third year graduate student in Computer Graphics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), 
supervised by  [Prof. Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/).

My interests lie at the intersection of physics based animation and geometry processing. Specifically I like how
the two can often intermingle in just the right way to provide rich features useful
for shape analysis, motion discovery, simulation acceleration, and control over animated characters. 

I recently received my Master's degree at the University of Toronto, where I was co-supervised by Profs [Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/) and [Alec Jacobson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/).
Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).
This summer, I'm on an internship at [Roblox Research](https://corp.roblox.com/research/), 
working with [Dr. Derek Liu](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hsuehtil/) and [Prof. Victor Zordan](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~vbz/).
